# 2023-Team-Gamma
This is the repository for Team Gamma's Hackathon project that was held on January 28th & 29th at the 2023 Summit at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Team Gamma is adding functionality to the Sales Order Shipment Process to Route Shipments for Delivery.  This includes the ability to select a group of shipments that have been confirmed, filtered by ShipDate, Warehouse and ShipVia.  The user can then assign a driver to handle the deliveries to the selected shipments, and then calculate the optimum delivery sequence for each.  These shipments will then be assigned to a Route and Driver.  Each shipment will be updated with the routing information.

The driver will have the ability to see the route on the map and complete the delivery to the stops.
